# Jack In The Box [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/matthieua/jackInTheBox.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/matthieua/jackInTheBox)

Reveal CSS animation as you scroll down a page.
By default, you should use it to trigger [animate.css](https://github.com/daneden/animate.css) animations.
But you can easily change the settings to your favorite animation library.

Advantages:
- Smaller than other javascript parallax plugins, like Scrollorama (they do fantastic things, but can be too much heavier for simple needs)
- Super simple to install, and works with animate.css, so if you already use it, that will be very fast to setup
- Fast execution and lightweight code: the browser will like it ;-)
- You can change the settings - [see below](#advanced-usage)
